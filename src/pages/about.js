                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I'm Beto Rendon, a Computer Science student with an interest in web & software development. I'm a horror film enthusiast (specially 80's films). I love reading and making music.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this website is to document everything I learn and to serve as a small glimpse of who I am.</p>
                    
                    <Link to="/books"><h3>ðŸ“š Books</h3></Link>
                    <p>I love reading and I've always wanted to have a personal library, but I dont think its reasonable buying a physical copy of every book I read for this sole purpose, being in the era of eBooks. So, as a way of documenting every book I read each year and creating my own virtual library I made <Link to="/books" style={{color: 'orange'}}>this page</Link></p>
                    
                    <Link to="/horrorfilms"><h3>ðŸ”ª Horror Films</h3></Link>
                    <p>I developed a liking towards them when I found a list of horror films to watch during October on twitter. I collect them <Link to="/horrorfilms" style={{color: 'orange'}}>here</Link> as a small monument to my hobby, as well as remembering the ones I liked and watching them again :D</p>
                    
                    <Link to="/photography"><h3>ðŸ“· Photography</h3></Link>
                    <p>I also like photography and do it as my hobby and side job. <Link to="/photography" style={{color: 'orange'}}>Here</Link> you can see some of the projects i've done, and if you are interested in a photography session, contact me ;)</p>
                    
                    <Link to="/certifications"><h3>ðŸ“œ Certifications</h3></Link>
                    <p>A humble wall to show off my <Link to="/certifications" style={{color: 'orange'}}>trophies</Link> ;D</p>
