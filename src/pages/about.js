                    <p>I love reading and I've always wanted to have a personal library, but being in the era of eBooks I don't think thats reasonable. So, I tried recreating the library feeling of looking at the title of a book on its side, and picking it up to look at the cover if interested in it, all in <Link to="/books" style={{color: 'orange'}}>this page</Link>.</p>

                    <p>I love horror movies even if they're bad (its scary thinking people used money to produce them D: ) and I wanted to create a <Link to="/horrorfilms" style={{color: 'orange'}}>small page</Link> (like a scrapbook from hell <span role="img" aria-label="devil">ðŸ˜ˆ</span>) to remember the movies I've watched so in the future I dont forget to watch them again.</p>
