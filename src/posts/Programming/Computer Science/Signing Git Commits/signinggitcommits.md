### Preface
Before we start, make sure to already have a GPG key. If you don't have one, check out [this post](www.b3tinsky.dev/blog/gpgkeypair).

### Adding key to Github
In your Github settings, look for the __SSH and GPG keys__ in the Access section.

Then add a title for the GPG we already created.

An important thing to mention, is that Github only lets you import keys that match your account email, so be careful when creating your keys.

### Signing commits
Before doing a commit or anything else, we must first create a user config file in your repository with the following values:
```output
[user]
    name = <Your name>
    email = <Your email>
    signingkey = <Your key email>

[commit]
    gpgsign = true

[tag]
    gpgsign = true
```

When doing a commit, you must add the __-S flag__, like this:
```console
git commit -S -m "Commit message"
```
