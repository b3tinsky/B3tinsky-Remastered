During 2020 I learned a lot of stuff, but all of it was almost at random, like things I had to learn for a class or by watching a tutorial about one thing, but learning another.

The technologies I plan on learning are mostly because of curiosity or to get a job ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I always see these jobs that ask for a million things and I wonder "How can anyone know all that stuff?", It may be an HR person who doesn't know what to look for, or maybe they know EXACTLY what to look for, but either way I think I should start to learn more bit by bit.

### Unit Testing
Taking my code to the next level by being able to catch bugs before production (Is it still a bug if it was solved before release?). I don't know if jobs look for this (I'm assuming they do, but even if they didn't it still is pretty useful). It could save a lot of headaches by preventing my code from breaking in front of someone üëÄ

### C Sharp
I learned a bit of C# in my "Videogame Project" class and I really enjoyed it. By going deeper I could probably make better games, BUT also, I've seen _some knowledge_ of C# is desired in some jobs, so It would still be pretty good to learn.

### Mobile Hybrid
There have been MANY times where I think of an app (in some cases very simple ones) but then discard the idea because I can't convert it to a website and I don't know how to code for android or ios. By learning React Nativ or Ionic o something like that, im hoping I can create more stuff with a variety of uses. 

### Web Assembly
I've heard really cool things about WebAssembly and I'm really curious about the things I could do with it. I've used Assembly and because of it I have a perception on the word as daunting, but I'm still excited to learn about it.

### Progressive Web Apps
Progressive Web Apps are like the tactical advantage when making websites, because it adds a lot of very cool features to our wonderful websites. I've seen the need for PWA experience in some jobs, but it's always in the "Preferable skills" section, so it wouldn't hurt to refine that knowledge.

### Sockets
Last year I used socket.io with some friends on a hackathon and I thought it was really cool (really complicated though), and this year I would like to at least understand fully how they work and what could I do with them.

Anyways, the year is just beginning, so who knows what I'll end up learning. I just like making lists and writing on my blog üòÅ
